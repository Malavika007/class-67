once upon a time there lived a monkey on a tree beside a river
 . He had no friends. One day he was eating the fruits while he saw a crocodile on the river bank.
 The crocodile asked him, 'could you give some fruits?' and the monkey agreed.
 the crocodile began to come to the monkey everyday to eat the fruits.
 they became good friends. one day the crocodile told his wife about the monkey and his fruits.
 the crocodile's wife told him 'the monkeys heart would be very tasty as he eats those fruits everyday'.
the crocodile became so angry. he told her 'dont say such things about my friend, you cant eat him'.
the crocodile's wife started crying and finally the crocodile agreed.
the next day crocodile asked the monkey to come to his house for dinner.
the monkey happily agreed. the monkey told him 'but how can i come to your house i cant swim' the crocodile asked him
to sit on his back. and they left. When they almost reached crocodile's home, the crocodile told the monkey ,
im sorry my friend but i lied to you we are going to eat you tonight.
the monkey was so afraid but he started to think. suddenly he got an idea
he told the crocodile 'oh y didnt you told me that earlier, i left my heart on the tree  lets go back and get it'
the stupid crocodile agreed. when they reached back, the monkey jumped to the top of the treee and told the crocodile,"you are a cheater how could you do this to meanyway im not coming anf=d you are an idiot how can someone ever seperate their heart from themselves??
" the crocodile was shocked. he felt bad about cheating on his friend.
